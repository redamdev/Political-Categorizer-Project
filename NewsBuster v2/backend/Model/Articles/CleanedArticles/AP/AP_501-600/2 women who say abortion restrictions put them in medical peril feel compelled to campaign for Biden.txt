And it’s really frightening ”Joshua and Zurawski will be in Raleigh, Durham and Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday, a state Biden hopes to flip  The state has enacted a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks, overriding a veto from the Democratic governor The week after that, they will visit Milwaukee, Eau Claire and Madison, Wisconsin, a state Biden won in 2020  Republicans in the state Assembly tried to set up a statewide referendum on the April ballot banning abortion after 14 weeks of pregnancy — more restrictive than current law — but the legislative session ended without a state Senate vote Both women said they felt compelled to get into politics after their own experiences “People don’t get how bad it is, and they don’t get how bleak it is," Zurawski said  “And so the more we continue to share our stories      I think it’s really important to spread awareness and paint this picture ”Zurawski, 37, of Austin sued Texas last year after she and other women could not get medical care because of the state's abortion laws  She had been in her second trimester, after 18 months of fertility treatments, when she went into early labor and was told the baby would not survive  Doctors said they could not intervene to provide an abortion because Zurawski wasn't in enough medical danger Zurawski had to wait  Three days later, her condition rapidly worsened and she developed sepsis, a dangerous medical condition in which the body responds improperly to an infection  She stabilized long enough to deliver a stillborn girl, whom she named Willow  Zurawski then spent days in intensive care She recently returned from a family trip to Disney World and said, "I thought I'd be coming home from that trip with a 1-year-old and be putting her down for a nap ”"But instead I'm doing this interview to help campaign for Biden," Zurawski said  "It's just the complete opposite world than I ever would have seen myself in ”
